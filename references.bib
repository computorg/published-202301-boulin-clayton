L’objectif est présenter de façon concise mais mathématiquement complète les modèles les plus classiques (second ordre et variogramme ; modèle latticiel et champ de Gibbs-Markov ; processus ponctuels) ainsi que leur simulation par algorithme MCMC. Vient ensuite la présentation des outils statistiques utiles à leur étude. De nombreux exemples utilisant R illustrent les sujets abordés. Chaque chapitre est complété par des exercices et une annexe présente brièvement les outils probabilistes et statistiques utiles à la statistique de champs aléatoires. [4e de couv.]},

abstract = {Many applications in risk analysis require the estimation of the dependence among multivariate maxima, especially in environmental sciences. Such dependence can be described by the Pickands dependence function of the underlying extreme-value copula. Here, a nonparametric estimator is constructed as the sample equivalent of a multivariate extension of the madogram. Shape constraints on the family of Pickands dependence functions are taken into account by means of a representation in terms of Bernstein polynomials. The large-sample theory of the estimator is developed and its finite-sample performance is evaluated with a simulation study. The approach is illustrated with a dataset of weekly maxima of hourly rainfall in France recorded from 1993 to 2011 at various weather stations all over the country. The stations are grouped into clusters of seven stations, where our interest is in the extremal dependence within each cluster.}

The Gaussian mixture representation of a multivariate t distribution is used as a starting point to construct two new copulas, the skewed t copula and the grouped t copula, which allow more heterogeneity in the modelling of dependent observations. Extreme value considerations are used to derive two further new copulas: the t extreme value copula is the limiting copula of componentwise maxima of t distributed random vectors; the t lower tail copula is the limiting copula of bivariate observations from a t distribution that are conditioned to lie below some joint threshold that is progressively lowered. Both these copulas may be approximated for practical purposes by simpler, better-known copulas, these being the Gumbel and Clayton copulas respectively.},

abstract = {Reducing the dimensionality of the complex spatio-temporal variables associated with climate modeling, especially ensembles of climate models, is a challenging and important objective. For studies of detection and attribution, it is especially important to maintain information related to the extreme values of the atmospheric processes. Typical methods for data reduction involve summarizing climate model output information through means and variances, which does not preserve any information about the extremes. In order to help solve this challenge, a dependence summary measure appropriate for extreme values must be inferred. Here, we adapt one such measure from a recent study to a larger domain with a different variable and gridded data from observations and climate model ensembles, i.e. E-OBS observations and the CNRM-CM5 model. The handling of such ensembles of data is proposed, as well as a comparison of the spatial clusterings between two different ensembles, here a present-day and a future ensemble of climate simulations. This method yields valid information concerning extremes, while greatly reducing the data set.}

abstract = {Estimation of missing values in climatological time series is an important task. In order to find an appropriate method, we examined six methods for estimating missing climatological data (daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature, air temperature, water vapour pressure, wind speed and precipitation) for different time scales at six German weather stations and three Bavarian forest climate stations. The multiple regression analysis (using the five closest weather stations) with least absolute deviations criteria (REG) predominantly gave the best estimation for daily, weekly, biweekly, and monthly maximum temperature, minimum temperature, mean temperature, water vapour pressure, wind speed, under different topographical conditions (valley, alpine foothills and mountain sites). The six methods gave similar estimates for the averaged precipitation amount. The mean absolute errors (MAE) of estimating climatological data using different techniques are of similar magnitude at the weather stations, but they are significantly different at the forest climate stations. For the same climatological variable (i.e., air temperature) for different time scales, mean absolute errors of estimated data are larger for shorter time scales (e.g., a day) than for longer ones (e.g., a month). For the different climatological variables, the most accurately estimated variables are maximum temperatures, mean temperatures and water vapour pressure, followed by minimum temperature and wind speed. The poorest results were obtained for precipitation data.}

An extreme-value copula is determined by its Pickands dependence function, which is a function on the unit simplex subject to certain shape constraints that arise from an integral transform of an underlying measure called spectral measure. Multivariate extensions are provided of certain rank-based nonparametric estimators of the Pickands dependence function. The shape constraint that the estimator should itself be a Pickands dependence function is enforced by replacing an initial estimator by its best least-squares approximation in the set of Pickands dependence functions having a discrete spectral measure supported on a sufficiently fine grid. Weak convergence of the standardized estimators is demonstrated and the finite-sample performance of the estimators is investigated by means of a simulation experiment.}

The theory is well established for data whose dependence structure is compatible with that of asymptotically dependent models. On the contrary, in many applications data do not comply with asymptotically dependent models and thus new tools are required. This article contributes to the methodological development of such a context, by considering a component-wise maxima approach. First we propose a statistical test based on the classical Pickands dependence function to verify whether asymptotic dependence or independence holds. Then, we present a new Pickands dependence function to describe the extremal dependence under asymptotic independence. Finally, we propose an estimator of the latter, we establish its main asymptotic properties and we illustrate its performance by a simulation study.}

Our proposed estimators do not require the estimation of the missing mechanism, and they enjoy stable performance even when the sample size is small. We prove that our estimators satisfy consistency and asymptotic normality. We also provide a consistent estimator for the asymptotic variance. We show via extensive simulations that our proposed method dominates existing alternatives.}

We formulate a generalized regression model which unifies many prominent cases such as the conditional mean and quantile regressions. A semiparametric copula and the target regression curve are estimated via the calibration approach. The consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimated regression curve are proved. We show via Monte Carlo simulations that the proposed approach operates well in finite samples, while a benchmark equal-weight approach fails with substantial bias under MAR. An empirical application on revenues and R&D expenses of German manufacturing firms highlights a practical use of our approach.}

This is reflected in the property that the conditional copula of Y1 and Y2 given X, does not depend on the value of X. This latter independence often appears as a simplifying assumption in pair-copula constructions. We introduce a general estimator for the copula in this specific setting and establish its consistency. Moreover, we consider some special cases, such as parametric or nonparametric location-scale models for the effect of the covariate X on the marginals of Y1 and Y2 and show that in these cases, weak convergence of the estimator, at $\sqrt{\mathrm{n}}-\mathrm{r}\mathrm{a}\mathrm{t}\mathrm{e}$, holds. The theoretical results are illustrated by simulations and a real data example.},

abstract = {A common assumption in pair-copula constructions is that the copula of the conditional distribution of two random variables given a covariate does not depend on the value of that covariate. Two conflicting intuitions arise about the best possible rate of convergence attainable by nonparametric estimators of that copula. On the one hand, the best possible rates for estimating the marginal conditional distribution functions are slower than the parametric one. On the other hand, the invariance of the conditional copula given the value of the covariate suggests the possibility of parametric convergence rates. The more optimistic intuition is shown to be correct, confirming a conjecture supported by extensive Monte Carlo simulations by Hobæk Haff and Segers (2015) and improving upon the nonparametric rate obtained theoretically by Gijbels et al. (2015). The novelty of the proposed approach lies in a double smoothing procedure for the estimator of the marginal conditional distribution functions. The copula estimator itself is asymptotically equivalent to an oracle empirical copula, as if the marginal conditional distribution functions were known.}

 abstract = {For many years there has been an interest in families of bivariate distributions with marginals as parameters. Genest and MacKay (1986a, b) showed that several such families that appear in the literature can be derived by a unified method. A similar conclusion is obtained in this article through the use of mixture models. These models might be regarded as multivariate proportional hazards models with random constants of proportionality. The mixture models are useful for two purposes. First, they make some properties of the derived distributions more transparent; the positive-dependency property of association is sometimes exposed, and a method for simulation of data from the distributions is suggested. But the mixture models also allow derivation of several new families of bivariate distributions with marginals as parameters, and they indicate obvious multivariate extensions. Some of the new families of bivariate distributions given in this article extend known distributions by adding a parameter to make them more flexible. Other families are derived that appear to be entirely new.},

Throughout experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our proposed approach fits the data better in terms of loglikelihood.

Their flexibility and practicality in moderate and high dimensions have contributed to the popularity of vine copulas, but relatively little attention has been paid to their extremal properties. To address this issue, we present results on the tail dependence properties of some of the most widely studied vine copula classes. We focus our study on the coefficient of tail dependence and the asymptotic shape of the sample cloud, which we calculate using the geometric approach of Nolde (2014). We offer new insights by presenting results for trivariate vine copulas constructed from asymptotically dependent and asymptotically independent bivariate copulas, focusing on bivariate extreme value and inverted extreme value copulas, with additional detail provided for logistic and inverted logistic examples. We also present new theory for a class of higher dimensional vine copulas, constructed from bivariate inverted extreme value copulas.}

abstract = {Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to improve generalization performance by learning multiple related tasks simultaneously. While sometimes the underlying task relationship structure is known, often the structure needs to be estimated from data at hand. In this paper, we present a novel family of models for MTL, applicable to regression and classification problems, capable of learning the structure of tasks relationship. In particular, we consider a joint estimation problem of the tasks relationship structure and the individual task parameters, which is solved using alternating minimization. The task relationship revealed by structure learning is founded on recent advances in Gaussian graphical models endowed with sparse estimators of the precision (inverse covariance) matrix. An extension to include exible Gaussian copula models that relaxes the Gaussian marginal assumption is also proposed. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on a variety of synthetic and benchmark data sets for regression and classification. We also consider the problem of combining Earth System Model (ESM) outputs for better projections of future climate, with focus on projections of temperature by combining ESMs in South and North America, and show that the proposed model outperforms several existing methods for the problem.},

The results are synthesized in the form of a decision tree: Given the values of some readily computable characteristics of the Archimedean generator, the upper and lower tails of the copula are classified into one of three classes each, one corresponding to asymptotic dependence and the other two to asymptotic independence. For a long list of single-parameter families, the relevant tail quantities are computed so that the corresponding classes in the decision tree can easily be determined. In addition, new models with tailor-made upper and lower tails can be constructed via a number of transformation methods. The frequently occurring category of asymptotic independence turns out to conceal a surprisingly rich variety of tail dependence structures.}

We examine the properties of doubly robust imputation procedures, which are those that lead to an estimator that remains consistent if either the outcome variable or the non-response mechanism is adequately modelled. We establish the double robustness property of the imputed estimator of the finite population distribution function under random hot-deck imputation within classes. We also discuss the links between our approach and that of Chambers and Dunstan. The results of a simulation study support our findings.},

It relies on the idea of simulating only the extremal functions, that is, those functions in the construction of a max-stable process that effectively contribute to the pointwise maximum. We further generalize the algorithm by Dieker \\&amp; Mikosch (2015) for Brown–Resnick processes and use it for exact simulation via the spectral measure. We study the complexity of both algorithms, prove that our new approach via extremal functions is always more efficient, and provide closed-form expressions for their implementation that cover most popular models for max-stable processes and multivariate extreme value distributions.

abstract = {Summary
In recent years droughts have been occurring frequently, and their impacts are being aggravated by the rise in water demand and the variability in hydro-meteorological variables due to climate change. As a result, drought hydrology has been receiving much attention. A variety of concepts have been applied to modeling droughts, ranging from simplistic approaches to more complex models. It is important to understand different modeling approaches as well as their advantages and limitations. This paper, supplementing the previous paper (Mishra and Singh, 2010) where different concepts of droughts were highlighted, reviews different methodologies used for drought modeling, which include drought forecasting, probability based modeling, spatio-temporal analysis, use of Global Climate Models (GCMs) for drought scenarios, land data assimilation systems for drought modeling, and drought planning. It is found that there have been significant improvements in modeling droughts over the past three decades. Hybrid models, incorporating large scale climate indices, seem to be promising for long lead-time drought forecasting. Further research is needed to understand the spatio-temporal complexity of droughts under climate change due to changes in spatio-temporal variability of precipitation. Applications of copula based models for multivariate drought characterization seem to be promising for better drought characterization. Research on decision support systems should be advanced for issuing warnings, assessing risk, and taking precautionary measures, and the effective ways for the flow of information from decision makers to users need to be developed. Finally, some remarks are made regarding the future outlook for drought research.}
